# 📚 Basic JavaScript – ITBOX

Hello! 👋 This is a basic JavaScript practice project I studied through the ITBOX program. This project covers an introduction to **variables**, **data types**, **math operators**, **logical operators**, and a few simple calculation examples using JavaScript.

## ✨ Topics Covered

### 🧮 Variables & Data Types
- `number`: example `var number = 157;`
- `string`: example `"Hello World"`
- `boolean`: `true`, `false`

### ➕ Math Operators
- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulus `%`
- Exponentiation `**`

### 🧠 Order of Operations
- Operator priority: `()` → `**` → `* /` → `+ -`

### 🤔 Logical Operators
- `&&` (AND)
- `||` (OR)
- `!` (NOT)
- `==` vs `===` (Equals)

### 🔬 Mini Case Studies
- Cube volume (`side * side * side`)
- Circle area (`phi * r * r`)
- Logic examples: `rich && healthy`, `rich || healthy`, `!rich`

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open the developer console (`Ctrl + Shift + I` or `F12`).
3. View the output from `index.js` in the "Console" tab.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand the basics of JavaScript programming
- Learn about operators & logic in programs
- Practice using console logs for debugging & exploration
